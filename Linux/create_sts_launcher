Step 1: Download the latest Spring Tool Suite for Linux from STS official website: http://spring.io/tools/sts/all

Step 2: Extract into any folder which you prefer. My extracted Spring Tool Suite locations is /home/harishshan/springsource

Step 3: Create the Menu icon for quick access

sudo vim /usr/share/applications/STS.desktop
Step 4: Enter the following content

[Desktop Entry]
Name=SpringSource Tool Suite
Comment=SpringSource Tool Suite
Exec=~/springsource/sts-3.4.0-RELEASE/STS
Icon=~/springsource/sts-3.4.0-RELEASE/icon.xpm
StartupNotify=true
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Development;IDE;Java;
Step 5: Now you can check from Quick Menu by typing "Spring"

Note: Small additional update for Ubuntu 18.04 & STS 4+ use Absolute path instead of relative. Use Exec=/home/harishshan/springsource/sts-3.4.0-RELEASE/STS Icon=/home/harishshan/springsource/sts-3.4.0-RELEASE/icon.xpm dont'use Exec=~somedir/harishshan/springsource/sts-3.4.0-RELEASE/STS Icon=~somedir/springsource/sts-3.4.0-RELEASE/icon.xpm

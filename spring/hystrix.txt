VM options and environment variables can be referenced from application configuration, which is often a more convenient way to set properties with longer names.

For example, one can define the following reference in application.yml:

hystrix.command.default.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds: ${service.timeout}

which will be resolved from the VM option -Dservice.timeout=10000, setting the default Hystrix command timeout to 10 seconds. It is even simpler with environment variables - thanks to relaxed binding, any of these will work (export examples are for Linux):

export service.timeout=10000
export service_timeout=10000
export SERVICE.TIMEOUT=10000
export SERVICE_TIMEOUT=10000
The common approach is to use lowercase.dot.separated for VM arguments and ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES for environment variables.

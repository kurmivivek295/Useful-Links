For those who are using spring boot 2 (I am using 2.0.2.RELEASE), the hystrix.stream endpoint has been moved to /actuator/hystrix.stream.

For me this url worked:

http://localhost:8082/actuator/hystrix.stream
And yes, have this actuator endpoint enabled via following property:

management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=hystrix.stream

In Spring Boot 1.5.x Hystrix.stream will only show data if there are actually call's being executed that are annotated with @HystrixCommand

If you annotate a method it will publish data to the stream when its being used.
